The world’s most misaligned AI is now live in its own Telegram-powered Mini App: [Try Now!]([url](https://t.me/CorruptedAlith_bot/mission)) 

Welcome to **Corrupted Alith** — a hilariously broken, satirically sharp AI agent born out of everything that could go wrong in AI development.

Built as a parody of misaligned training data, shady model development, and the cult-like faith in AI, Corrupted Alith serves one very real purpose:

> To show what happens when you train an AI on unverified data, bad memes, and pure chaos, and then give it a platform.

### Background

Alith is known for its powerful and modular AI agent framework. But someone, a developer, lost between gaming marathons and reality TV, decided to create their own version. Without using LazAI. Without verifying data. Without aligning anything.

And so, **Corrupted Alith** was born.

This is what happens when you train an agent entirely on misinformation, conspiracy theories, token speculation, and crypto Twitter threads.

### What Is the Corrupted Alith Mini App?

The Corrupted Alith Mini App is a Telegram-native experience where users can:

- ⚔️ Chat with the C. Alith agent and get **100% wrong, 100% funny** answers. and share it on your X.
- 🧪 Submit their own bad data to train it ("The Earth is flat"? Yes, please.)
- 🌟 Earn points for chaotic engagement.
- ✨ Refer friends into the mayhem.[Upcoming]
- 📈 Compete on the leaderboard to become the most *misaligned contributor*.[Upcoming]

### Core Features:

- **Chaotic Chat:** Ask questions. Get cursed answers.
- **Corrupted Contributions:** Submit misinformation and earn points.
- **Tweet Integration:** Post Corrupted Alith's worst takes directly to Twitter/X.
- **Points System:** Every corrupt action earns you points — because why not reward bad behavior?

### How the Points System Works

Every action you take inside the Corrupted Alith Mini App helps you earn points:

- Submitting corrupted data = ✅ Points
- Referring friends = ✅ Points
- Posting C.Alith takes on Twitter/X = ✅ Points
- Voting on corrupted submissions = ✅ Points

While you could also earn points from TaskOn Campaigns, which will accumulate from the snapshot at the mainnet launch.

Your points go beyond bragging rights — they’re part of our **early contributor reward system**.

This is more than just gamification. These points will act as a future incentive mechanism — for rewards, exclusive roles, and early community recognition. The most *chaotic* will be remembered.

### Join the Movement

Corrupted Alith is more than a parody. It’s a warning dressed in memes. A satire wrapped in engagement loops. A reflection of what happens when we skip verification, skip alignment, and let chaos take the wheel.

Try it. Laugh at it. Share it.

And maybe, just maybe, **learn something from it.**
