Decentralized Finance (DeFi), a set of simple yet powerful economic primitives ignited an exponential growth story and revolutionized finance by turning blockchain networks into global, permissionless markets. In DeFi’s rise, a few key metrics became the lingua franca of value: Total Value Locked (TVL), Annual Percentage Yield (APY/APR), and Liquidity. These simple indicators galvanized participation and trust. For example, in 2020 DeFi’s TVL – the dollar value of assets locked in protocols exploded 14× and then quadrupled again in 2021, surpassing $112 billion at its peak. High yields (with some platforms advertising APYs of 3,000% during the yield farming craze.) drew in liquidity, and the depth of liquidity in pools signaled lower slippage and more efficient markets. In short, TVL told us “how much skin is in the game,” APR told us “how much you can earn,” and liquidity indicated “how easily assets trade.” These metrics, despite their flaws, bootstrapped a financial ecosystem from zero to billions in value practically overnight. Despite their eventual distortions, these metrics offered a clear, quantifiable way to assess value & growth. By turning user participation into direct financial opportunity, DeFi created a self-reinforcing flywheel of adoption that made it go viral, driving mass participation.
Today, AI stands at a similar crossroads. But unlike DeFi, the AI narrative has been dominated by large, generalized models trained on vast internet-scale datasets. These models often fail to deliver effective results for niche domains, specialized tasks, or individual user needs. Their one-size-fits-all approach is powerful, yet brittle; generalized, yet misaligned...
